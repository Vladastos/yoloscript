# Type Inference Implementation Guide

## Fresh Start

You've chosen to build the type inference system step-by-step with tests. This is the right approach—it ensures you understand each piece deeply.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Understand the Full Picture
```bash
# Read README.md (you are here)
# Then read ROADMAP.md (5-10 min)
```

### 2. Check Phase 1 Tests Pass
```bash
cd tree-walk-interpreter
cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_1
```

Expected output:
```
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_creation ... ok
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_display ... ok
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_generator_fresh ... ok
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_generator_counter ... ok
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_ordering ... ok
test phase_1_type_variables::test_type_var_hashable ... ok

test result: ok. 6 passed
```

### 3. Start Phase 2
Open [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) and follow Phase 2 section.

## 📝 Implementation Workflow for Each Phase

### Template: How to Do a Phase

**1. Read the roadmap**
```
→ Open ROADMAP.md
→ Find "Phase N: ___"
→ Read "What", "Definition", "Tasks"
```

**2. Examine test stubs**
```
→ Open tests/typeinference_tests.rs
→ Go to phase_N_xxx section
→ Look at test names and comments
```

**3. Implement in src/typeinference/mod.rs**
```rust
// Add your code here
pub struct MyNewType { ... }
impl Display for MyNewType { ... }
```

**4. Implement test assertions**
```rust
// Replace todo!() with actual test code
#[test]
fn test_something() {
    let result = my_function();
    assert_eq!(result, expected);
}
```

**5. Run tests**
```bash
cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_N
```

**6. Fix any failures**
- Debug implementation
- Update test if needed
- Re-run tests

**7. Celebrate** ✅
Move to next phase

---

## 🧪 Test Structure

All tests are in `tests/typeinference_tests.rs` organized by phase:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_1_type_variables { ... }   // ✅ Complete

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_2_infer_types { ... }       // Next: Add your impl here

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_3_unification { ... }

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_4_substitution { ... }

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_5_constraints { ... }

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_6_type_schemes { ... }

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_7_inference_context { ... }

#[cfg(test)]
mod phase_8_integration { ... }
```

### Running Tests

**All tests**:
```bash
cargo test --test typeinference_tests
```

**Specific phase**:
```bash
cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_2
```

**Specific test**:
```bash
cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_2::test_infer_type_concrete
```

**With output**:
```bash
cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_2 -- --nocapture
```

## 🔗 The 8 Phases at a Glance

| Phase | What | Key Type | Lines of Code |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Type variables | `TypeVar` | ~50 |
| 2 | Inference types | `InferType` | ~100 |
| 3 | Unification | `unify()` fn | ~150 |
| 4 | Substitution | `Substitution` | ~100 |
| 5 | Constraints | `Constraint` | ~80 |
| 6 | Type schemes | `TypeScheme` | ~150 |
| 7 | Context | `InferContext` | ~200 |
| 8 | Integration | expression walk | ~300 |

**Total**: ~1,130 lines of implementation + tests

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing each phase, you should be able to answer:

**Phase 1**: 
- How do you generate fresh type variables?
- Why do type variables need unique IDs?

**Phase 2**:
- What's the difference between `Type` (concrete) and `InferType` (with variables)?
- Why do you need both?

**Phase 3**:
- How does unification work at a high level?
- What's the occurs check and why does it matter?

**Phase 4**:
- What's a substitution and when do you apply it?
- How do you compose two substitutions?

**Phase 5**:
- What's a constraint and why collect them separately?
- How do you solve multiple constraints together?

**Phase 6**:
- What's generalization and when does it happen?
- What's instantiation and when does it happen?

**Phase 7**:
- What state does the inference context maintain?
- How do monomorphic and polymorphic environments differ?

**Phase 8**:
- How does the expression walker generate constraints?
- How does constraint solving produce a typed AST?

## 💡 Tips for Understanding

### When You Feel Lost
1. Re-read the "What" section in ROADMAP.md
2. Look at the examples in the roadmap
3. Study the test cases—they show expected behavior
4. Run tests with `--nocapture` to see error messages

### When Tests Fail
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check if your implementation matches the test's expectations
3. Add `println!()` statements to debug
4. Run a single test to focus: `cargo test phase_2::test_x -- --nocapture`

### When You Have Questions
- Look for "Key Concept" sections in ROADMAP.md
- Check CONCEPTS.md for deep explanation of concepts
- Read test comments—they often explain the intent

### Building Intuition
After each phase, think about:
- **What problem does this solve?** (e.g., Phase 3 unification solves "how do I determine if ?t0 must be Int?")
- **When would you use it?** (e.g., Substitution is applied after unification determines bindings)
- **How does it connect to previous phases?**

## What to Do Now

1. **Read** [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) completely (understand all 8 phases)
2. **Look at** the Phase 2 test stubs in `tests/typeinference_tests.rs`
3. **Implement** Phase 2 in `src/typeinference/mod.rs`
4. **Run** `cargo test --test typeinference_tests phase_2`
5. **Verify** all tests pass
6. **Repeat** for Phases 3-8

**Time estimate**: 1 week for thorough understanding, 2-3 days for implementation
